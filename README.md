## GitHub

- Profile Widgets - **[anuraghazra/github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)**

  *I love this project so much. It makes GitHub profile creation so much easier, plus it tells me the exact percentage of coding languages I use.*

- Recommendation List - **[FTEdianiaK/breathtaking](https://github.com/FTEdianiaK/breathtaking)**

  *Yeah, I know, quite the self advertisement, but I'd just like if more people showed their support for the devs of stuff they like (and need) with more than just a like or star. (And I know, money's also great for that, but few lines can go a long way as well, can't they?)*

- Badges - **[badges/shields](https://github.com/badges/shields)**

  *Truly, an amazing thing, supports Simple Icons (mostly brands) and is so customizable. Really breathtaking.*

## Editors

- Editor - **[notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus)**

  *Notepad, editor. Whatever you need, Notepad++ can probably do it. (Not really, but at least when it comes to code and text editing, it can.)*

- Editor Plugins - **[francostellari/NppPlugins](https://github.com/francostellari/NppPlugins)**

  *AutoSave, I came to love after getting used to VSC. And RunMe was always my friend for things that just didn't want to play nice.*

- Compare Plugin - **[pnedev/comparePlus](https://github.com/pnedev/comparePlus)**

  *Diff, file compare, ... It does what it says on the can, but in a really elegant and breathtaking way.*

- Markdown Viewer Plugin - **[mohzy83/NppMarkdownPanel](https://github.com/mohzy83/NppMarkdownPanel)**

  *If you're like me and work with so many markdown files, get yourself this extension and save yourself the trouble of guessing what the final file looks like.*

- MIME Plugin - **[npp-plugins/mimetools](https://github.com/npp-plugins/mimetools)**

  *URL/Base64 encoding/decoding is a bit of a must-have for me, so I'm always super grateful for this plugin when I see it in the little plugin menu in N++.*

- Editor - **[microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)**

  *Out of all the editors I tried so far, I liked VSC the most. It's versatile and friendly without a steep learning curve. I like it.*

- Validator Plugin - **[celian-rib/vscode-webvalidation-extension](https://github.com/celian-rib/vscode-webvalidation-extension)**

  *For more info about the validator, scroll down. But using it would be so much harder if it weren't for this plugin. Just a click and it does all the work, no need to manually enter stuff into the website and Alt+Tab between the editor and the website as it shows all the errors right in VSC.*

- Scenarist's Plugin - **[piersdeseilligny/betterfountain](piersdeseilligny/betterfountain)**

  *One of the only usable Fountain editors for Windows. It's pure bliss. Statistics, previews, PDFs, just... breathtaking!*

## Python

- Icons - **[game-icons/icons](https://github.com/game-icons/icons)**

  *My go-to place for icons when I need one for... well, pretty much anything. Mostly use it for my software and LiveSplit. Not sure if that's okay, hope it is. Either way, really love the icons. They're breathtaking.*

- HTTP Library - **[psf/requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)**

  *Never parsed a website in Python with anything else than requests, was kinda surprised that it's not part of the Python Standard Library.*

- Progress Bar Library - **[rsalmei/alive-progress](https://github.com/rsalmei/alive-progress)**

  *Love the scale of this library. It's so customizable, from those pretty animations to how it behaves in the code. Breathtaking.*

- Python Executables - **[pyinstaller/pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller)**

  *Once again, couldn't imagine making an exe file out of a python script any other way. It's also really customizable, making errors such as forgotten libraries easily fixable with couple of parameters and flags.*

- Python Linter - **[pycqa/pycodestyle](https://github.com/pycqa/pycodestyle)**

  *PEP8 is a way of life, maaan. ... Sorry, but honestly, be nice to your future self and make your Python code PEP8-compliant and write doc-strings for all your functions. Trust me, there's nothing worse than coming back to your outdated code and realizing your past self was an idiot who didn't know anything about good coding practices and (rambling continues)*

## Websites

- HTML+CSS Validator - **[w3c/markup-validator](https://github.com/w3c/markup-validator)**

  *My editor catches a lot of errors on its own, but another pair of eyes helps. Plus, it catches stuff that even my editor doesn't, such as valid, yet deprecated paramaters.*

- WebPref Testing Tool - **[YellowLabTools/YellowLabTools](https://github.com/YellowLabTools/YellowLabTools)**

  *Once again, trying to optimize the website, but having no idea what I'm doing and where to start, I was lucky to find YellowLabTools. Since then, I check my website with my self-hosted instance. (Thx, Docker.)*

- Webhosting - **[neocities/neocities](https://github.com/neocities/neocities)**

  *Seriously, couldn't ask for better webhosting. Free, if you want to, and for a steal you get 50 GBs of space and WebDAV access? What's not to like!?*

- CSS Template - **[JaniRefsnes/w3css](https://github.com/JaniRefsnes/w3css)**

  *Can't even begin to imagine having to build a website without W3.CSS. It has so many things already built in and with understandable css, it's so easily extensible.*

- Icons - **[icons8/line-awesome](https://github.com/icons8/line-awesome)**

  *After ForkAwesome ended and with FontAwesome not really working for me, I was so happy to stumble across Line Awesome. It just works, what more can you ask for.*

- Stock Imagery - **[Unsplash/Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)**

  *Might be a bit biased, but this is still a really great source of stock imagery. When it comes to my website, if it ain't by me, it's from Unsplash.*

- JavaScript Counter - **[jshakes/Simple countup animation](https://codepen.io/jshakes/pen/KKpjdYv)**

  *Love this. Simple, yet pretty and effective.*

- Javascript Lazyloading - **[aFarkas/lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)**

  *Trying to optimize the website as much as possible, I'm really glad I found lazysizes. Yeah, I know you can lazyload using HTML, but this has LQIP built-in and works really well.*

- Web Analytics Service - **[arp242/goatcounter](https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter)**

  *I always wanted a hit counter (i.e. a page view counter), but didn't want to use Google. (Never, won't sell personal info of my fave personae!) After months of nothing, I finally had the bright idea of checking AlternativeTo and there I found it, the perfect solution, GoatCounter. (The data is deleted after a year, btw.)*

## Games

- Music Creator - **[irshadshalu/music-grid](https://github.com/irshadshalu/music-grid)**

  *So far, my favorite for music making. Even easier to use than Bosca Ceoil was (and yes, was). Not good at it, if you wanna know, but... can't have a game without music, I suppose.*

- SFX Creator - **[SFBGames/ChipTone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone)**

  *Made by the amazing SFBGames and forked from the great DrPetter's sfxr, comes this wonderful sound effect generator. Didn't have a chance to use it for anything yet, but keeping it in my library for sure.*

- Game Assets - **[Kenney/Assets](https://kenney.nl/assets)**

  *If you need pre-made assets, look no further than Kenney's asset library. Amazing stuff, most (if not all) CC0. 2D, 3D, SFX, fonts, they got it all!*
